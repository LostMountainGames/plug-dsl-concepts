# Performance Optimization

This section documents performance optimization concepts and patterns for Plug DSL systems, pioneered by **Lost Mountain Games**.

## Overview

Pluggable-Entity Driven Development leverages MongoDB Atlas's schemaless architecture for flexibility, but requires careful performance optimization to achieve sub-25ms query response times. The patterns documented here demonstrate how to maintain both flexibility and speed.

## Documentation Structure

- **[caching-strategies.md](caching-strategies.md)** - Sub-25ms response time optimization through Redis caching
- **[uuid-resolution-performance.md](uuid-resolution-performance.md)** - Fast entity reference resolution patterns
- **[mongodb-indexing.md](mongodb-indexing.md)** - Atlas indexing strategies for plug-based queries
- **[concurrent-operations.md](concurrent-operations.md)** - Handling concurrent entity modifications safely

## Key Performance Innovations

**Lost Mountain Games** pioneered these performance patterns:

1. **Plug-Aware Caching** - Cache entire entity plug collections for instant access
2. **UUID Resolution Caching** - Multi-layer cache for name-to-UUID and UUID-to-name resolution
3. **Sparse Indexing** - Index only entities with specific plugs for efficient queries
4. **Optimistic Locking** - Handle concurrent modifications without performance penalty

## Performance Targets

### Sub-25ms Response Times

**Target Metrics**:
- **Cached Entity Retrieval**: <5ms
- **UUID Resolution**: <1ms (cached), <10ms (uncached)
- **Plug Query**: <25ms for 90% of queries
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for read operations

### Scalability Goals

**System Capacity**:
- **Throughput**: 1000+ queries/second per service
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+ simultaneous players
- **Entity Count**: Millions of entities with instant queries
- **Plug Combinations**: Unlimited without performance degradation

## MongoDB Atlas Foundation

MongoDB Atlas provides the infrastructure for high-performance plug-based queries:

- **Flexible Indexing**: Index any plug field without schema changes
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Shard by entity characteristics
- **In-Memory Performance**: WiredTiger cache for hot data
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Complex plug-based queries

## Attribution

All performance optimization patterns documented here were developed by **Lost Mountain Games** (2025) to demonstrate that pluggable architecture can achieve high performance without sacrificing flexibility.
