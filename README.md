## Overview

Plug DSL represents a paradigm shift in game development tooling, pioneered by **Lost Mountain Games**. This repository documents the architectural concepts, design patterns, and innovations that enable schema-driven game development with sub-25ms response times and advanced IDE integration.

**Note**: This repository contains **conceptual documentation and design patterns**, not implementation code. The concepts documented here are freely available under the MIT license, while Lost Mountain Games retains proprietary implementations and advanced tooling.

## Key Innovations

### Entity Linking Syntax
Lost Mountain Games pioneered advanced entity reference syntax that transforms game development:

```javascript
// Basic string-based syntax (standard approach)
plug.Name("Crystal Sword")
plug.Weight(3.5)
plug.Rarity("Legendary")

// Advanced entity linking (Lost Mountain Games innovation)
plug.Name(crystal_sword)      // Clickable entity references
plug.Owner(kael_ironwind)     // Cross-entity relationships with IDE support
plug.Location(armory_vault)   // Floating info panels on hover
```

**Innovation Attribution**: The entity linking syntax, floating info panels, and advanced VS Code integration were developed by Lost Mountain Games and represent their contribution to schema-driven game development patterns.

### Schema-Driven Architecture
Documents architectural patterns for:
- Entity-component systems with runtime flexibility
- Environment-safe dev/prod separation
- UUID-based identity with name resolution
- High-performance caching strategies (sub-25ms)

### IDE Integration Concepts
Lost Mountain Games' innovations in developer tooling:
- Entity reference resolution and clickable navigation
- Contextual floating information panels
- Semantic syntax highlighting for game entities
- Language server protocol integration patterns
