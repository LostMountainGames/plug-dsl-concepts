# Pluggable-Entity Driven Development

**Innovation Attribution**: The Pluggable-Entity Driven Development philosophy documented here was pioneered by **Lost Mountain Games** (2025) and represents a revolutionary approach to game architecture where **development IS documentation** and entities are limitless collections of pluggable components.

## Overview

Pluggable-Entity Driven Development fundamentally reimagines game architecture by eliminating rigid class hierarchies in favor of pure composition through pluggable components. Every entity—whether character, location, item, or concept—is simply a collection of plugs stored in MongoDB's schemaless architecture. This approach enables unlimited creativity, zero documentation drift, and architectural flexibility previously impossible in traditional game development.

**Core Philosophy**: Development IS Documentation, Documentation IS Development, Everything IS Plugs

## Revolutionary Principles

### 1. No Classes, Just Plugs

**Principle**: Entities are collections of plugs, not instances of classes.

There are no predefined entity "types." A character is not a Character class instance—it's an entity with character-like plugs. A location is not a Location class instance—it's an entity with location-like plugs. An entity can have ANY combination of plugs.

```javascript
// NOT a Character class, NOT a Location class
// Just an entity with plugs
entity Heart_of_Worldtree {
  // Location-like plugs
  plug.LocationType("CosmicNexus")
  plug.Region("PlanarCore")

  // Character-like plugs
  plug.Personality("Ancient, wise, speaks in riddles")
  plug.Will(20)
  plug.CanSpeak(true)

  // The system doesn't care about categories
  // It just stores and retrieves plugs
}
```

**See**: [no-classes-just-plugs.md](no-classes-just-plugs.md) for detailed architecture

### 2. Unlimited Composition

**Principle**: Any plug can be combined with any other plug, enabling cross-category entities that break traditional boundaries.

Want a talking sword? Plug in speech components. Want a mobile fortress? Plug in movement components. Want a sentient location? Plug in personality components. The system imposes no artificial limits.

```javascript
// Living Weapon: Item + Character plugs
entity Soulrend_Glaive {
  plug.ItemType("MagicalGlaive")
  plug.Damage("3d6+3")
  plug.Personality("Thirsts for battle")
  plug.Will(15)
  plug.Memories("Recalls every soul claimed")
}

// Mobile Fortress: Location + Movement plugs
entity Ironwolf_Fortress {
  plug.LocationType("MobileFortress")
  plug.Contains([great_hall, armory, barracks])
  plug.Speed(2)
  plug.MovementType("Wheeled")
}
```

**See**: [unlimited-composition.md](unlimited-composition.md) for cross-category patterns

### 3. UUID-Based Reference System

**Principle**: Three-layer architecture separates human authoring (names), stable storage (UUIDs), and current display (resolved names).

Content creators write human-readable entity names. The system automatically resolves names to stable UUIDs for storage. UI displays resolve UUIDs back to current names. When an entity's name changes, all references automatically update—no broken links.

```javascript
// Author writes:
plug.Chieftain(war_chief_ironwind)

// System stores (MongoDB):
"Chieftain": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"

// UI displays:
"Chieftain: War Chief Ironwind"

// Name changes to "Elder Ironwind"
// UI updates everywhere, UUID reference unchanged
"Chieftain: Elder Ironwind"
```

**See**: [uuid-reference-system.md](uuid-reference-system.md) for reference architecture

### 4. Tags as Entities

**Principle**: Tags are themselves entities with rich metadata, enabling hierarchical organization without rigid schemas.

Tags aren't simple strings—they're full entities that can have colors, icons, descriptions, and their own plugs. This enables rich, evolving organizational systems.

```javascript
// Tag entity with metadata
entity character_tag {
  plug.Name("Character")
  plug.Description("Entities representing people and NPCs")
  plug.Color("#4A90E2")
  plug.Icon("person")
  plug.SortOrder(1)
}

// Use tags for organization
entity Kael_Ironwind {
  plug.Tag(character_tag)
  plug.Tag(warrior_tag)
  plug.Tag(ironwolves_tag)
}
```

**See**: [tag-as-entity-architecture.md](tag-as-entity-architecture.md) for organizational patterns

### 5. Extensibility Without Brittleness

**Principle**: System grows through plug addition, not architectural modification.

Adding new features doesn't require changing core classes or system architecture. Define new plugs and use them. The MongoDB schemaless foundation ensures entities can evolve freely.

```javascript
// Day 1: Basic character
entity Kael {
  plug.Name("Kael Ironwind")
  plug.Will(16)
}

// Day 100: Add reputation system (no code changes!)
entity Kael {
  plug.Name("Kael Ironwind")
  plug.Will(16)
  plug.Reputation(iron_wolves, "Revered")
  plug.Reputation(southern_kingdoms, "Hated")
}

// Day 365: Add magic affinity (no migrations!)
entity Kael {
  plug.Name("Kael Ironwind")
  plug.Will(16)
  plug.Reputation(iron_wolves, "Revered")
  plug.Reputation(southern_kingdoms, "Hated")
  plug.MagicAffinity("Fire", 8)
  plug.MagicAffinity("Earth", 3)
}
```

**See**: [extensibility-without-brittleness.md](extensibility-without-brittleness.md) for growth patterns

## Development IS Documentation

**Core Innovation**: Every entity definition is simultaneously executable code and human-readable documentation.

```javascript
entity Crystal_Sword {
  plug.Name("Crystal Sword")                        // Self-documenting
  plug.Description("A legendary blade infused with magical crystals")
  plug.Damage(15)                                   // Designer sees: 15 damage
  plug.Weight(3.5)                                  // Developer sees: 3.5 weight
  plug.Rarity("Legendary")                          // QA sees: test legendary drops
  plug.ElementalType("Ice")                         // Balance sees: ice damage type
  plug.SpecialAbility("FrostBurst")                 // All read same source of truth
}

// NO separate documentation file
// NO documentation drift
// ONE source of truth for everyone
```

**Traditional Problem**:
- Code says: `damage = 15`
- Docs say: "Damage: 10 (updated 6 months ago)"
- Wiki says: "Damage: 12 (community edit)"
- Designer thinks: "I thought it was 8?"

**Pluggable-Entity Solution**:
- Entity says: `plug.Damage(15)`
- Everyone sees: 15
- Zero drift possible

## MongoDB Atlas Foundation

**Why Schemaless Enables Pluggable Architecture**:

Traditional relational databases require rigid schemas. Adding a new plug means ALTER TABLE migrations, downtime, and versioning nightmares. MongoDB Atlas's schemaless architecture enables true plug-and-play:

```javascript
// Day 1: Entity with basic plugs
{
  "_id": "sword_uuid",
  "plug": {
    "Name": "Sword",
    "Damage": 10
  }
}

// Day 2: Plug in new component (instant!)
{
  "_id": "sword_uuid",
  "plug": {
    "Name": "Sword",
    "Damage": 10,
    "FrostDamage": 15  // Just... appeared!
  }
}

// MongoDB Atlas: "Stored. What else you got?"
```

**Atlas Advantages**:
- Add plugs instantly - zero migration
- Store heterogeneous entities with different plug combinations
- Index any plug field for fast queries
- Scale horizontally as plug complexity grows

## Key Architectural Insights

### The Power of "Just Plugs"

When everything is just a collection of plugs, artificial boundaries disappear:

- ✅ Characters can be locations (mobile strongholds)
- ✅ Items can be characters (sentient weapons)
- ✅ Locations can be items (portable pocket dimensions)
- ✅ Factions can be characters (hive minds)
- ✅ Rules can be entities (living spells)
- ✅ Tags can be entities (with their own metadata)

**Revolutionary Insight**: The system doesn't care about human categorizations—it just stores and retrieves plugs. This enables unlimited creativity without architectural constraints.

### Solving Architectural Brittleness

**Traditional Approach (Brittle)**:
```javascript
// Predefined class - must modify to extend
class Character {
  name: string
  health: number
  // Need magic? Modify this class
  // Need reputation? Modify this class
  // Need custom attributes? Modify this class
  // System becomes increasingly complex
}
```

**Pluggable Approach (Flexible)**:
```javascript
// Entity - just add plugs
entity Character {
  plug.Name("Kael")
  plug.Health(100)
  // Need magic? Plug it in
  plug.MagicPower(25)
  // Need reputation? Plug it in
  plug.Reputation(faction, "Revered")
  // Need anything? Just plug it in
  // System never changes
}
```
